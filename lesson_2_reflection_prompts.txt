What happens when you initialize a repository? 	Why do you need to do it?

	You turn a working directory into a git repository. You do it to explicitly tell git
	that you want the directory to become a repository. (git init)



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?



	It serves as an intermediate place holder for files before committing files.
	This allows you to commit logical files instead of committing everything.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?


	You only add the associated files to the staging areas to be committed.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
 organized? 
How would branches help?

	When you are experimenting with new functions or new settings while still needing 
	a working version. Branches help to maintain a working version while allowing you to 
	experiment with new settings.
