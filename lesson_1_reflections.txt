How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped to compare easily

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So that you can understand your thought process as you went along.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: there is logic to when you save it. Ex. save when you finish a module or item as opposed
	 to random saves halfway through creating a module. 
    Con: You may wait too long between saves therefore increasing risk. It is also more difficult 
	 to find bugs if you wait too long before saving because you did too much between versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They are all linked?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Not sure.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You have a functional version you can restore incase you break the program.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
